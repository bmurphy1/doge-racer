##Doge Racer

Build a back end to our JavaScript racer game using a simple Sinatra app. The game still runs in a single browser instance, i.e., two players don't play each other across different browsers, but rather on a single browser.

HOW TO PLAY:
Press your key as fast as you can to race your shibe!

player 1 - press q
player 2 - press p


User stories:
+Two people get on a computer and visit the application
+The application prompts each player to enter their name
+The players fill out the form and this creates a new game
+The new game starts, and each player smashes their respective key until one of them wins
+After one of them wins, the winning player and amount of time it took to win is sent to the server and the game is recorded as being "done"
+The players can choose to start another game using their same initials, or restart using different initials
+After a game is finished the players are given a unique URL at which they can view the results of that particular game
